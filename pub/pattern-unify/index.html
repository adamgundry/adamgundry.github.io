    A higher-order unification algorithm is an essential component of
    a dependently typed programming language implementation, and
    understanding its capabilities is important if dependently typed
    programmers are to become productive.  Miller showed that, for
    simply typed &lambda;-terms in the pattern fragment (where
    metavariables are applied to spines of distinct bound variables),
    unification is decidable and most general unifiers exist.  We
    describe an algorithm for pattern unification in a full-spectrum
    dependent type theory with dependent pairs (&Sigma;-types).  The
    algorithm exploits heterogeneous equality and a novel concept of
    'twin' free variables to handle dependency.  Moreover, it supports
    dynamic management of constraints, postponing equations that fall
    outside the pattern fragment in case other equations make them
    simpler.  We aim to make sense both to language implementors and
    users, and to this end present our algorithm as a Haskell program.

    <strong>Important note:</strong> if you are interested in this
    paper, you may be better off reading chapter 4
    of <a href="../thesis/">my thesis</a>, which presents this
    material more thoroughly.  On the other hand, the paper is
    substantially more compact.  There is an error in the description
    of pruning (in both the paper and thesis), described in the
    <a href="../thesis/thesis-errata.txt">thesis errata</a>.
