  <h1>Type Inference, Haskell and Dependent Types</h1>

  <p>
This thesis studies questions of type inference, unification and
elaboration for languages that combine dependent type theory and
functional programming.  Languages such as modern Haskell have very
expressive type systems, allowing the programmer a great deal of
freedom.  These require advanced type inference and unification
algorithms to reconstruct details that were left implicit, and
suitable representation of the evidence delivered by such algorithms.
</p>

<p>
The first part proposes an approach to unification and type inference,
based on information increase in dependency-ordered contexts, and
keeping careful track of variable scope.  Two existing systems are
reviewed: the Hindley-Milner type system, and units of measure in the
style of Kennedy.  Subtle issues relating to let-generalisation become
clearer as a result.  Using the same approach, an algorithm is
described for Miller pattern unification in a full-spectrum dependent
type theory, forming a foundation for the elaboration of dependently
typed languages.
</p>

<p>
The second part introduces <em>inch</em>, a language that extends Haskell with
type-level data and functions, and dependent product types.
Type-level numbers and arithmetic operations are specifically
considered, as a particularly useful source of applications, such as
the perennial example of vectors (length-indexed lists).  The
increased expressivity in the source language is matched by a suitable
core language of <em>evidence</em>, into which <em>inch</em> programs can be
translated.  This language is based on System F<sub>C</sub>, the existing core
language used by GHC, and adapted to clarify the relationships between
the type and term levels.  It gives a coherent operational semantics
to both levels, allowing shared data and dependent functions, but
retaining a clear phase distinction.  The contextual approach of the
first part of the thesis is used to specify the elaboration of <em>inch</em>
into the <em>evidence</em> language, and applications of <em>inch</em> based on
type-level arithmetic are demonstrated.
