    Cross-stage persistence rules are commonly admitted in multi-
    stage programming languages. These rules codify the assumption that all
    module and package dependencies are available at all stages. However,
    in practice, only a small number of dependencies may be needed at each
    particular stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    This paper introduces Explicit Level Imports, a mechanism which gives
    programmers precise control about which dependencies are required at
    each stage. Imports are annotated with a modifier which brings identifiers
    into scope at a specific level. This precision means it is straightforward
    for the compiler to work out what is exactly needed at each stage, and
    only provide that. The result is faster compilation times and the potential
    for improved cross-compilation support.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have implemented these ideas in GHC Haskell, consider a wide variety
    of practical considerations in the design, and finally demonstrate that the
    feature solves a real-world issue in a pragmatic way.
